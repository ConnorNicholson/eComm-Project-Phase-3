# eComm-Project-Phase-3
This repo is for my eCommerce Website - Phase 3

NOTE: This is not the finished project, all files included are part of the MVP

Currently in this repo:
1. This README.md
2. LICENSE
3. Design Folder (contains the ERD and the Functional Diagram, both in .png format)
4. .gitignore
5. Package.json / Package-lock.json
6. proxy folder (contains proxy.js file, this is required to target the React App port and send responses to the client)
7. route folder (contains Express Router API routes)
8. dB_schema (contains MySQL DataBase)
9. client folder (contains React App that is currently in sync with the express server in the server folder)
10. server.js (contains the express server and makes the magic happen)

Additional Notes:

In the package.json file in the root directory, there are custom scripts that allow the developer to start both the Express server and the React App at the same time. To execute this script, open Terminal and run this line:
    npm start

Enjoy :D
